# 🧠 Depression Detection from Survey Data

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and classify levels of depression among university students based on psychological assessments and demographic data.

## 📋 Project Overview

The primary goal is to build a predictive model using features like CGPA, age, academic year, gender, and DASS-21 scale values (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scores). Various machine learning models are trained and compared to identify the most effective approach for detecting depression levels.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes survey responses with the following key features:

* **Depression, Anxiety, Stress Values** (from DASS-21 scale)
* **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Academic Year
* **Academic Info**: CGPA (mapped from ranges), Waiver/Scholarship status
* **Depression Label**: Categorical target indicating severity:

  * 0 = No Depression
  * 1 = Minimal Depression
  * 2 = Mild Depression
  * 3 = Moderate Depression
  * 4 = Moderately Severe Depression
  * 5 = Severe Depression

---

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

* **Label Encoding** for ordinal categorical features (e.g., CGPA ranges, age brackets)
* **One-Hot Encoding** for binary features (e.g., gender, scholarship status)
* **Missing Value Handling**: Imputation using column means for numeric features
* **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
* **Data Augmentation**: Gaussian noise added to training data for robustness

---

## 📈 Models Trained

The following models were trained and evaluated:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **XGBoost Classifier**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Network)**

Each model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision (weighted)
* Recall (weighted)
* F1 Score (weighted)
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report

Additionally, **XGBoost** undergoes hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.

---

## 📊 Results & Comparison

The performance of each model is compared visually using bar charts. The model with the best F1 Score is identified for potential deployment.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
